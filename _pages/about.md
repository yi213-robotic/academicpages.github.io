Hello! I am Yi Wang, a PhD student in robotics at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). My research focuses on algorithmic robotic motion planning, bidirectional heuristic search, and optimal control. I am currently collaborating with Professor [Oren Salzman](https://orensalzman.com/) and [Dr. Eyal Weiss](https://sites.google.com/view/eyal-weiss) at Technion on optimizing the interplay between sampling-based motion planning and bidirectional heuristic search—a framework that dramatically improves solution-finding efficiency in high-dimensional continuous state spaces.
