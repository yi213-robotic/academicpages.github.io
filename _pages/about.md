Hello! I am Yi Wang, a PhD student in robotics at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). 

My research focuses on algorithmic robotic motion planning for kinodynamic system, bidirectional heuristic search, and optimal control. 

I am currently collaborating with Professor [Oren Salzman](https://orensalzman.com/) and [Dr. Eyal Weiss](https://sites.google.com/view/eyal-weiss) at [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/) to optimize the interplay between sampling-based motion planning and bidirectional heuristic search—a framework that significantly improves solution-finding efficiency in high-dimensional continuous state spaces.
